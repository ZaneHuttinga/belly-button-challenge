An interactive webpage featuring three data visualizations for each of the options in a drop-down menu. The page is created using HTML and JavaScript.

## index.html

## static

This folder contains the directory '/js/app.js' where the JavaScript file can be found. This file defines several functions in order to create a bar chart, a bubble chart and a list of properties for the selected item in the drop-down menu. The .js file uses d3 to read the data from the url https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json.

## samples.json
A copy of the data needed for the JavaScript functions. This file is not used locally but can be used for reference.
